#!/bin/bash

# This script should be called as follows (after setting all options below as needed):
# nohup bash run_sat_benchmark.sh --run path/to/benchmark-file 2>&1 > OUT &
# After executing this command, you can press Ctrl+C and later log out of the server 
# PROPERLY, i.e., with "exit" and not due to a connection timeout.
# 
# The progress can be monitored in real time with:
# tail -f OUT
# Also check with `htop` that the machine's cores are actually busy.
# 
# To stop/cancel an experiment running in the background, run:
# bash run_sat_benchmark.sh --stop
# 
# You can extract basic coverage / run time information from finished experiments like so:
# bash sat_benchmark.sh --extract path/to/my/experiment
# The provided path must contain a folder named i for each instance index i.
# In that path, some text files with raw information will be created.
# - qualified-runtimes-and-results.txt: 
#   Contains one line for each instance with its ID, the run time (= time limit if 
#   unsolved) and the found result ("sat" or "unsat" or "unknown").
# - qualified-runtimes-{sat,unsat}.txt:
#   Contains one line for each instance found {SAT, UNSAT} with its ID and the run time.
# - cdf-runtimes.txt, cdf-runtimes-{sat,unsat}.txt:
#   Using one of these files as a sequence of x- and y-coordinates, you will get a 
#   performance plot as commonly used by the SAT community. The x-coordinate is the time 
#   limit per instance and the y-coordinate is the number of instances solved in that 
#   limit.
